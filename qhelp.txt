Aims of the game
----------------
Use the letter wheel to guess words on the board.
Clear the puzzle by finding all of the words.
All words will be anagrams or part-anagrams of the wheel.
Words must be between 3 and 7 letters in length.

See example below:
FIYSH = Jumbled letters of the keyword "FISHY"
A valid guess would be "FISH" 
An invalid guess would be "HISS" (as there's only one S in FISHY)

Avoid wrong guesses (invalid words, or duplicate entries).
Look for hidden words to put in the word bag for a bonus.
Some puzzles have time or (wrong) guess limits!

Playing the game
-----------------
When you start the game a puzzle board will appear.
The Key Word will be jumbled and stored in the 
letter wheel on the right.

You can use the keyboard to type these letters and they
will appear in the word rack below.

Use backspace to clear a letter. 
Use UP arrow to shuffle the letters in the wheel.
Use the exact letters (and counts of) in your guesses.

If you're using an emulator or handheld PC you can use
arrow keys to rotate the letter wheel and press space
to choose the letter at the top of the wheel. 

Each word tile will be masked with a  diamond.
As you guess the correct words they will un-mask.

Word Types
----------
KWord - Key Word, 1 per puzzle.
PWord - Puzzle Word - sits alone, more difficult to guess. 
PWords are not in all puzzles..
XWord - Cross Word - intersects with other XWords or the KWord.
OWord - Off-board word hidden and a bonus.
You do not need to find OWords to clear a puzzle.

Progress, Records & Stats
-------------------------
There are two game modes in xyWords:

1) Free Play
This is a group of puzzles you can freely attempt at any time.
The first time you complete one, the time you took to find
the keyword is recorded and cannot be updated.

But all of the other records and statistics can be updated as 
you replay the puzzle. 

2) Collection Play
These are curated lists of puzzles which you must play in order.
Out of the box - xyWords ships with 3 collections.

As you complete puzzles, the next one unlocks.
You can replay completed puzzles at any time.

Note: Records are kept per puzzle, so if a puzzle appears 
in more than one collection - the record will appear the same.
