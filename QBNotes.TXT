xyWords: Text-Mode Edition (xyMDA) Development Notes

Editing/Compiling Requirements
------------------------------
Quickbasic 4.5 (run QB.EXE with no parameters)
Do not use QB64, Qbasic or anything else.
Load XYMDA.BAS first then use the "Load File" menu to Load XYMDA_2.BAS
Both files are "linked" when compiling
If you run this within the QB4.5 IDE ensure you CHDIR to the folder where the source is.
Otherwise you'll get an error XYPUZ.DAT can't be found.
